Known bugs:

      o RedHat-modified libpcap issue

        This is not a bug, but a "feature" of the RedHat-modified
        libpcap (included in at least RedHat 6.2).  Apparently,
        specifying a filter to the library is a programmatic
        requirement, whether the bpf expression is empty or not.  

	This issue is verified by running ngrep without a bpf filter
	expression and not observing any traffic when traffic is known
	to exist.

	Uninstall RedHat's modified libpcap, and replace with the
	latest libpcap, located at: ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z
