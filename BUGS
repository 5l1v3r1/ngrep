Known bugs:

      o error message: ngrep uses obsolete (PF_INET,SOCK_PACKET)

        Not a bug in ngrep.  Upgrade to the latest libpcap:

	    http://www.tcpdump.org/release/libpcap-0.6.2.tar.gz

      o ngrep reports duplicate packets on the local loopback interface
 
	Not a bug in ngrep.  Upgrade to the latest libpcap:

	    http://www.tcpdump.org/release/libpcap-0.6.2.tar.gz

      o 'ngrep host foo.com' segfaults after displaying interface info

        Technically, not a bug in ngrep.  A particular API call in
        libpcap segfaults on certain operating systems (FreeBSD is
        one).  Newer versions of libpcap obviate the need to use that
        particular API.  You can get it at:

	    http://www.tcpdump.org/release/libpcap-0.6.2.tar.gz

	For the time being, a configure switch '--without-restart' is
	provided to turn off the API call.  If your copy of ngrep
	segfaults after displaying the interface info, try recompiling
	with this switch.
