Installation Guide
------------------

For most, installation of ngrep will be as simple as typing:

    % ./configure ; make 

Those of you looking for the quick way out, there you have it.  Keep
in mind, you need libpcap installed before you can compile ngrep.  You
can get it at ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z.

If you still have problems compiling or are compiling on an
unsupported OS, try playing with other build types -- i.e. if you have
a BSD derived system, try the BSD build type.  Otherwise, email the
author.

Sparse, I know.
