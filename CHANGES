v1.42
        o rewrote the entire configure.in/config.h.in to autoconf 2.57
          to be more consistent with normal autoconf'd programs.
          corrects bugs around packaging impediments and typos.

        o improved privilege dropping code and added more options to
          configure to govern its behaviour

        o added flag to turn off privilege revocation logic

        o added multiline match as default and ability to enforce
          previous default single-line match (bugfix + feature)

        o added ability to read bpf filter expression from file

        o added ability to force the column width to a certain size

        o added two new output modes: ``byline'', whose output
          respects embedded carriage returns (useful for http dumps),
          and ``none'', which prints out each dump as a single line no
          matter what.

        o added ability to specify alternate nonprintable character
          (default is ``.'').

        o made ``-q'' effects more consistent and usable for scenarios
          where ``-I'' and/or ``-O'' are being employed

        o documentation updated

v1.41
        o added -S (set limitlen)
        o added LOOP and SLL tests for portability/old libpcap'en
        o added configure --safe-user and dropprivs code
        o added TCP ECN congestion header recognition
        o improved support for a few OSes
        o relaxed some restrictions in the license (COPYRIGHT -> LICENSE)
        o 802.11 support

v1.40.1
        o MacOS X support
        o ISDN (SLL) support
        o OpenBSD tun device support
        o updated configure.in to support specifying pcap directory
        o updated config.sub and config.guess
        o added scripts/multi.pl, parallel ngrep perl script
        o very minor change to documentation

v1.40
        o license change, amends the BSD advertising clause
        o fixed bug from not considering caplen in payload length
          calculations
        o added -s (set bpf caplen)
        o fixed header include for linux glibc 2.2 (time.h wasn't
          being included)

v1.39.2
        o typographical error, -p works now

v1.39.1
        o added in AIX includes
        o added BSD* includes for display updates
        o added -p (don't go into promiscuous mode)

v1.39
        o in standard match mode, the display now updates when window
          sizes change
        o configure now gives the user the option to compile with the
          pcre library, which is more license-friendly (albeit slower)
        o fixed minor bug in date printing with -t
        o added configure option '--without-restart', which will
          remove the pcap restart API call.  Newer versions of libpcap
          don't need it, and on certain platforms the API call
          segfaults.
        o win32: compiled with winpcap's pcap.h, which apparently
          breaks the pcap standard and introduces its own data link
          layer types.  fixes the 'unsupported interface' error folks
          sometimes got when used with a 100bT adapter

v1.38
        o binary matching
        o windows compilation support
        o 64-bit clean patch to regex.c
        o dump and replay pcap_dump files
        o officially licensed under the BSD license
        o normal and diff/delta timestamps

v1.37
        o added FDDI support

v1.36
        o added -l (line buffer stdout)
        o a few optimizations were made to shave off some cpu cycles
          spent on processing each packet
        o fixed bug where the blank regex algorithm wasn't even being
          used
        o fixed bug in blank regex algorithm that was preventing '-n'
          from working
        o change to compile on LinuxPPC
        o change to nix potential warnings on other OSes
        o change to not exit if pcap_lookupnet fails

v1.35
        o appears that the release of 1.34 had only one of the
          match optimizations: somehow only the tcp match was updated;
          udp change was omitted.  fixed.
        o moved -v (version) to -V
        o added -v (grep -v), invert match
        o added -d lo (null linktype)
        o added ability to match proto icmp
        o updated configure.in to handle old installations of pcap
          more gracefully (i.e. continue on by adding the necessary
          defines and just gripe)

v1.34
        o merged in patch from Andrew W. Flury <aflury@nas.nasa.gov>
          for hex printing, made minor modification to patch to not
          print off the end of the buffer
        o added an optimization for the case where no regex was
          specified; should account for a little speed up

v1.33
        o fragment changes, this should be it

v1.32
        o switched around regex -w/-i logic
        o fragment bugfixes

v1.31
        o added -A (match after)
        o Makefile.in changes
        o configure.in changes for solaris
        o added manpage (ngrep.8)

v1.30

        o bugfix: wasn't malloc'ing enough for word_regex
        o bugfix: case-insensitive was tolower()ing the word_regex
          itself

v1.29

        o added -e (show empty)
        o one or two safe, preemptive changes catching possible int
          overflows

v1.28

        o added -n
        o no required arguments anymore
        o regex's are not required anymore, can just be bpf logic
        o probably a bugfix or two
