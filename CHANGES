v1.39.1	
	o added in AIX includes
	o added BSD* includes for display updates

v1.39
	o in standard match mode, the display now updates when window
	  sizes change
	o configure now gives the user the option to compile with the
	  pcre library, which is more license-friendly (albeit slower)   
	o fixed minor bug in date printing with -t
        o added configure option '--without-restart', which will
	  remove the pcap restart API call.  Newer versions of libpcap
	  don't need it, and on certain platforms the API call
	  segfaults. 
        o win32: compiled with winpcap's pcap.h, which apparently
	  breaks the pcap standard and introduces its own data link
	  layer types.  fixes the 'unsupported interface' error folks
	  sometimes got when used with a 100bT adapter

v1.38
	o binary matching
	o windows compilation support
	o 64-bit clean patch to regex.c
	o dump and replay pcap_dump files
	o officially licensed under the BSD license
	o normal and diff/delta timestamps

v1.37  
        o added FDDI support

v1.36
	o added -l (line buffer stdout)
	o a few optimizations were made to shave off some cpu cycles
	  spent on processing each packet 
	o fixed bug where the blank regex algorithm wasn't even being
	  used 
	o fixed bug in blank regex algorithm that was preventing '-n'
	  from working
        o change to compile on LinuxPPC
	o change to nix potential warnings on other OSes
	o change to not exit if pcap_lookupnet fails
	          
v1.35
	o appears that the release of 1.34 had only one of the 
	  match optimizations: somehow only the tcp match was updated;
	  udp change was omitted.  fixed.
	o moved -v (version) to -V
        o added -v (grep -v), invert match
	o added -d lo (null linktype)
	o added ability to match proto icmp 
	o updated configure.in to handle old installations of pcap
	  more gracefully (i.e. continue on by adding the necessary
	  defines and just gripe) 

v1.34
	o merged in patch from Andrew W. Flury <aflury@nas.nasa.gov>
	  for hex printing, made minor modification to patch to not
	  print off the end of the buffer
	o added an optimization for the case where no regex was
	  specified; should account for a little speed up

v1.33
	o fragment changes, this should be it

v1.32
	o switched around regex -w/-i logic
	o fragment bugfixes

v1.31
	o added -A (match after)
	o Makefile.in changes 
	o configure.in changes for solaris
	o added manpage (ngrep.8)

v1.30 

	o bugfix: wasn't malloc'ing enough for word_regex
	o bugfix: case-insensitive was tolower()ing the word_regex
	  itself 

v1.29

	o added -e (show empty)
	o one or two safe, preemptive changes catching possible int
	  overflows 

v1.28

	o added -n
	o no required arguments anymore
	o regex's are not required anymore, can just be bpf logic
	o probably a bugfix or two
