Todo:

	o add non-ip protocols           (IPX and Appletalk are up next, maybe NetBeui?)

        o add flag to specify packet flags (supported by bpf filters,
          but under consideration)
      
        o switch to pcre for regex support  (under consideration)

	o -T == display time diff from start (completed)

	o replay should use timestamp stored in file to sleep packet
          delays (completed)

	o add "Extra info", i.e. display ToS, seq, id, etc.
